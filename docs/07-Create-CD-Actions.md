# Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment

Continuous delivery and/or continuous Deployment can greatly ease the issues of getting your finished code or product into your end users hands.
Automation of the process greatly helps reduce human issues and enables for faster delivery/deployment.

It all boils down to what you are building, and how often it is built. If you only need to cut a release every few months, then automation may not be ideal, but a solid workflow could help ease the process. If you are deploying weekly, daily, hourly, then having the workflow connected to events will greatly help the process.

The examples we have will help solve most of the use cases.
